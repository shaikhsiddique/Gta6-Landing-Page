# GTA 6 Landing Page 🎮🔥

🚀 **We launched a GTA 6 landing page… before Rockstar did!**  
Since GTA 6 keeps getting delayed, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create this **animated, responsive landing page** inspired by the iconic Grand Theft Auto series.

This project is a fun, creative teaser built using modern web development tools — giving fans something to enjoy while we wait (and wait…) for the official release.
